"# Lab00-start" 
This is a template repo that you will use to start your assignment.
Yours will have your username and choose a destination, this only works for me:

 usethis::create_from_github("https://github.com/bst-urmc/Lab00-start.git", destdir="~/Documents/work/teaching/BST430")
 
Topics that can be demonstrated in this lab:
editing in RStudio
new rstudio 
adding from GitHub online
